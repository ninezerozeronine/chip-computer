    Input
    Output
        scan column (8 bits)
            Number from 0 - 159 giving the index of the current column.
        scan row (8 bits)
            Number from 0 - 119 giving the index of the current row.
        hsync (1 bit)
            The horizontal sync pulse. This is a low going pulse.
        vsync (1 bit)
            The vertical sync pulse. This is a low going pulse.
        hblank (1 bit)
            The horizontal blanking period. When high - this is the blank portion of each row.
        vblank (1 bit)
            The vertical blanking period. When high - this is the blank portion of each frame - a good time to swap buffers!
        anyblank (1 bit)
            Any period of time where no image is being displayed.

        The order of porches and pulses seems to be:

            Back porch
            Display
            Front porch

            Per the DSView traces, the falling edge of the hsync pulse
            coincides with the faling edge of the vsync pulse. This would
            indicate that a line starts and ends with the falling edge of
            the hsync pulse.


        Take the 25.175MHz crystal and divide by 4 to get 6.29375 MHz / 158.887ns per pixel.
